## @deftypefn {Function File} {} colormap (@var{map})
## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} colormap ("default")
## Set the current colormap.
##
## @code{colormap (@var{map})} sets the current colormap to @var{map}.  The
## color map should be an @var{n} row by 3 column matrix.  The columns
## contain red, green, and blue intensities respectively.  All entries
## should be between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The new colormap is returned.
##
## @code{colormap ("default")} restores the default colormap (a gray scale
## colormap with 64 entries).  The default colormap is returned.
##
## With no arguments, @code{colormap} returns the current color map.
